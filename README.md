# Upsparkle

Cross-platform updater for .NET and Xamarin. This library brings the latest platform-specific self-updating framework to Xamarin Mac / .NET Windows applications via a custom native implementation. This is made possible by two native libraries:

- On Windows, via wrapping [Winsparkle](https://winsparkle.org).
- On macOS, via wrapping [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org).
